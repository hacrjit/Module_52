    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns or behaviors in data that deviate significantly from the norm. Here's how unsupervised learning can be applied in anomaly detection:\n",

    "4. **One-Class SVM:** One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for binary classification, where the goal is to distinguish between normal and abnormal data points. One-Class SVMs learn a decision boundary around normal data points, identifying anomalies as points outside this boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Autoencoders:** Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct input data. Anomalies are identified as data points that are not well-reconstructed by the autoencoder, indicating that they differ significantly from normal data.\n",
